"well uh today has been absolutely horrible one of the worst days in a very long time i think, my dad woke me up at 8am because we were due to go on a walk somewhere, i didnt expect the 8am start but whatever, we went to the local cafe for breakfast and then we went to fishguard sorta area to go for a walk",
"its a walk and you know by now that walks mean talking about shit, so we spent like the most of the day walking and talking which was already not amazing, had to go through the whole YWNBAW thing again which is really draining and upsetting and yeah, i just dont really like it when people tell me that!!!",
"we spent most of the day doing this and only came back at around 3pm or something which is quite crazy i think, i got an interview with lidl for my job so its not all bad ig, then i had to do meditation again, only 6 days left until im done with that dogshit",
"worst part was at dinner, one thing came to another and i ended up with my mum yelling at me and being very MEAN to me, first time my parents have made me cry like ever, she is immensely transphobic and im not sure what to do because i feel awful and i feel like im not gonna be able to make it through this with how shes being, im genuinely scared of what she will do, and equally scared of what she will say",
"especially considering what she has already said, i dont wanna sound super steven universe coded but it turns out that your mum telling you horrible transphobic things actually really fucks with you and makes you feel like a piece of shit",
"the only other notable thing today is that the petrol station we went to for lunch had the new lando norris monster flavour, but i couldnt buy it ofc so its whatever",
"this just in as im writing this entry, my mum also seems to have set up a wifi cutoff time for the internet too fucking thanks alot way to make me feel even more dogshit nice fucking job"

"TODAY STARTED OUT FINE TOO like i had loads of time for music (by loads of time i mean not really that much but whatever), meditation bullshit and the main thing for today was that we dont have food for tonight",
"and GUESS WHAT THAT MEANS, IT MEANS WE HAVE TO GO TO AMBERS PARTY (which my parents have previously said they wouldnt take me to again) THANKS ALOT",
"and unsurprisingly taking me to the party made me feel like absolute dogshit and i want to die because why did i have to get born to the most transphobic person i know AND THEN ALSO happen to be trans like this is horseshit luck i dontget it why meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee",
"i nearly had a pannick attack in the car afterwards and we had to leave early bc of me which im glad for fuck them",
"im gonna do something about the wifi router password too because im so fucking mad at everything right now, my mum is without much reason at all and is constantly victimising herself and its driving me nuts"
