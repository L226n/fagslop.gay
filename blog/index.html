		im listening to some new musics and im also excited bc theres only 11 days left until i see my wife in finland i love her alot<br><br>
		was also thinking and i think that chainlink mistress is probably the same person as yotzeret sheydim it seems p likely from the information available<br><br>
		i also think that when i release my new album which i have not yet started work on ill ask desdemona if i release on tshn bc that would be cool i think, ill have to make the album quite good and i wanna do that anyway but releasing on tshn would be so flames<br><br>
		its later in the day now and omg i ate so much junk food i ate two monsters in one day i got bad apple and watermelon reserve then i had pizza dinner i wanna get fatter boobs hopefully all the fat will go to by boobs who knows<br><br>
