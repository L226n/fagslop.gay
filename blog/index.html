		crazy things happened late last night.... i was planning to ask hannah if she wanted to meet up before i left uni for a couple days and then she messaged me asking if i wanted to do that which is so awesome... we are going to see a movie called sinners tomorrow at 8pm which is amazing im quite excited it will be fun bc i rarely watch movies and its always cool to see someone because i never see anyone ever<br><br>
		i made a delicious halloumi stew tonight and it was very tasty, i love halloumi, i saw a magpie being very angry at a cat on the way to the shops too i posted it on bsky if anyone wants to see a magpie yell at a bird,,, still gotta get cheese tomorrow though and also take out cash to pay hannah for my cinema ticket<br><br>
		also talked to my mum today and she asks me if i want anything in particular for my birthday bc its coming up soon and it might be possible that im getting a couple of really really cool tapes from yotzeret sheydim... she probably thinks something is up bc of how often i order from here but its fine i love her music its so amazing<br><br>
		been playing a ridiculous amount of nubbys number factory recently too bc its really fun not much to say there other than the fact that its really cool and if u have the money to spare i would definitely recommend it its fun and games possibly<br><br>
		another day with alot of music too, i relistened to a blackmeatrader album i have on cd and its actually really good, i also listened to pickmick mit hermann finally after having it on cd for ages and it was pretty good, some really cool tracks but there was one track which i really disliked that bought it down quite a bit<br><br>
		relistening to rivers as human beings by janis lago as i write this blog entry and oh my god its so beautiful every track is peak i feel like i might cry a bit but thats also from the fact that im feeling especially pathetic tonight and i really want to be touched and stroked and rubbed and wow i yeah im normal yeah im so excited ot meet my wife in about a week now, she says that she can do these things for me and i really hope it can happen but at the same time i feel like i would just start crying and maybe faint if she did but i will hope she does regardless because its all i want really<br><br>
		thats about it for today,.. no images because theres no images or whatever

		im listening to some new musics and im also excited bc theres only 11 days left until i see my wife in finland i love her alot<br><br>
		was also thinking and i think that chainlink mistress is probably the same person as yotzeret sheydim it seems p likely from the information available<br><br>
		i also think that when i release my new album which i have not yet started work on ill ask desdemona if i release on tshn bc that would be cool i think, ill have to make the album quite good and i wanna do that anyway but releasing on tshn would be so flames<br><br>
		its later in the day now and omg i ate so much junk food i ate two monsters in one day i got bad apple and watermelon reserve then i had pizza dinner i wanna get fatter boobs hopefully all the fat will go to by boobs who knows<br><br>
