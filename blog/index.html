		last night i also ordered some cheap cds from tuluum shimmering because they are awesome designs and i like them alot so hopefully i get them pretty soon yeah yay fun awesome yay aawawwa<br><br>
		listened to the last of my random cds from cd shop and it was pretty good, i also visited the url on the cover (darkambient.net) and they had a funny visitors counter so i added that to my site for shits and giggles its at the top right if u look up there<br><br>
		not much else hmmmm.......<br><br>
		TO MY PARENTS if ur reading this then please go away and let me have somewhere i can talk without having to censor out shit that i dont want you knowing THANK YOU BYE

		im going to fucking lose my mind today has been ridiculous and idk what to do even this is so stupid what the hell help<br><br>
		my parents found my bsky acc somehow which is obviously really not good at all and i really dont know how to procede from here because this is obviously really not good yeah amazing im so glad that this happened im so glad that they poke into my stuff and trace my accounts im so glad that they totally respect my privacy and poke around t olook for my personal stuff like please fuck off please please please<br><br>
		i also saw hannah and saw the sinners movie, it was pretty good movie but i nearly cried saying goodbye to hannah and then cried for quite a bit after i got home because im so sad that im probably never gonna see her again and it makes me cry thinking about it so i think i will stop writing this part<br><br>
		relistening to rivers as human beings again because its absolutely amazing its so fucking good i love it so much it got its rating upped from 4 to 4.5, i also listened to an artist a friend recommended and it was really good, they do cheap cd releases too so thats great i might maybe get some if i like some more of their releases, artist name is tuluum shimmering<br><br>
		overall today im really not great because of my parents finding my bsky like everything was going so well and now this dogshit happens why cant they just leave me to have some place i can say stuff without having to worry about them seeing it like fuck off fuck off fuck off fuck off fuck off fuck off fuck off fuck off fuck off fuck off fuck off fuck off fuck off fuck off fuck off fuck off fuck off fuck off fuck off fuck off fuck off fuck off fuck off fuck off fuck off fuck off fuck off fuck off fuck off fuck off fuck off fuck off fuck off fuck off fuck off fuck off fuck off fuck off fuck off fuck off fuck off<br><br>

		crazy things happened late last night.... i was planning to ask hannah if she wanted to meet up before i left uni for a couple days and then she messaged me asking if i wanted to do that which is so awesome... we are going to see a movie called sinners tomorrow at 8pm which is amazing im quite excited it will be fun bc i rarely watch movies and its always cool to see someone because i never see anyone ever<br><br>
		i made a delicious halloumi stew tonight and it was very tasty, i love halloumi, i saw a magpie being very angry at a cat on the way to the shops too i posted it on bsky if anyone wants to see a magpie yell at a bird,,, still gotta get cheese tomorrow though and also take out cash to pay hannah for my cinema ticket<br><br>
		also talked to my mum today and she asks me if i want anything in particular for my birthday bc its coming up soon and it might be possible that im getting a couple of really really cool tapes from yotzeret sheydim... she probably thinks something is up bc of how often i order from here but its fine i love her music its so amazing<br><br>
		been playing a ridiculous amount of nubbys number factory recently too bc its really fun not much to say there other than the fact that its really cool and if u have the money to spare i would definitely recommend it its fun and games possibly<br><br>
		another day with alot of music too, i relistened to a blackmeatrader album i have on cd and its actually really good, i also listened to pickmick mit hermann finally after having it on cd for ages and it was pretty good, some really cool tracks but there was one track which i really disliked that bought it down quite a bit<br><br>
		relistening to rivers as human beings by janis lago as i write this blog entry and oh my god its so beautiful every track is peak i feel like i might cry a bit but thats also from the fact that im feeling especially pathetic tonight and i really want to be touched and stroked and rubbed and wow i yeah im normal yeah im so excited ot meet my wife in about a week now, she says that she can do these things for me and i really hope it can happen but at the same time i feel like i would just start crying and maybe faint if she did but i will hope she does regardless because its all i want really<br><br>
		thats about it for today,.. no images because theres no images or whatever

		im listening to some new musics and im also excited bc theres only 11 days left until i see my wife in finland i love her alot<br><br>
		was also thinking and i think that chainlink mistress is probably the same person as yotzeret sheydim it seems p likely from the information available<br><br>
		i also think that when i release my new album which i have not yet started work on ill ask desdemona if i release on tshn bc that would be cool i think, ill have to make the album quite good and i wanna do that anyway but releasing on tshn would be so flames<br><br>
		its later in the day now and omg i ate so much junk food i ate two monsters in one day i got bad apple and watermelon reserve then i had pizza dinner i wanna get fatter boobs hopefully all the fat will go to by boobs who knows<br><br>
